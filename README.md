In this terminal game, you need to kill enemies by connecting and disconnecting your MacBook from the charger. Each connection and disconnection counts as one shot.

It should be noted that these actions may affect the remaining number of charge cycles for the notebook's battery, but please don't take this game seriously; it was, of course, made in jest, just to have some fun.

The game is available for macOS only.
